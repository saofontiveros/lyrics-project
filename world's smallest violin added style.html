            <h3 style="font-size:25px;">[Verse 1]</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
                He was such a noble dude<br>
                I can't even finish school<br>
                Missed my mom and left too soon<br> 
                <br>
                His dad was a fireman<br> 
                Who fought fires so violent<br> 
                I think I bored my therapist<br>
                While playing him my violin<br>
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size:25px;">[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                <i>(Oh my God)</i> That's so insane<br>
                <i>(Oh my God)</i> That's such a shame<br>
                Next to them, my <del title="Word has been blocked because of profanity.">####</del><sub>1</sub> don't feel so grand<br>
                But I can't help myself from feeling bad<br>
                I kinda feel like two things can be sad<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size:25px;">[Chorus]</h3> 
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The world's smallest violin<br>
                Really needs an audience<br>
                So if I do not find somebody soon<br>
                <em>(That's right, that's right)</em><br>
                I'll blow up into smithereens <br>
                And spew my tiny symphony<br>
                Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you<br>
                <br>
            </p>

                My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
                He was such a noble dude<br>
                Man, I feel like such a fool<br>
                I got so much left to prove<br>
                All my friends have vaping friends<br>
                They're so good at making friends<br>
                I'm so scared of caving in <br>
                Is that entertaining yet?<br>
            </p>

                Somewhere in the universe<br>
                Somewhere someone's got it worse<br>
                Wish that made it easier<br>
                Wish I didn't feel the hurt<br>
                The world's smallest violin<br>
                Really needs an audience<br>
                So if I do not find somebody soon<br>

                <b><em><ins title="An accelerando is a direction in music which means 'gradually getting faster'.">accelerando</ins></em></b><sup>1</sup><br><br>
                I'll blow up into smithereens<br>
                And spew my tiny symphony<br>
                All up and down a city street<br>
                While tryna put my mind at ease<br>
                Like finishing this melody<br>
                This feels like a necessity<br>
                So this could be the death of me<br>
                Or maybe just a better me<br>
                <br>
                Now come in with the timpanis<br>
                And take a shot of Hennessy<br>
                I know I'm not there mentally<br>
                But you could be the remedy<br>
                So let me play my violin for you<br>
